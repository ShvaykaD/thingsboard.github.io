TBMQ provides logging for integration-related events, allowing users to **debug and troubleshoot** integration behavior.
Below are three 'Event' types:

- **Lifecycle Events** – Logs events such as 'Started', 'Created', 'Updated', 'Stopped' etc.
- **Statistics** – Provides insights into integration performance, including the number of 'Messages processed' and 'Errors occured'.
- **Errors** – Captures failures related to authentication, timeouts, payload formatting, or connectivity issues with the external service.
